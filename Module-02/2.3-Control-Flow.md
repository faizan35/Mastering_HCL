# Control Flow in HCL

### Conditional Statements (`if` and `else`):

1.  **Basic `if` Statement:**

    - Use `if` for basic conditional logic.
    - Example:

      ```hcl
      variable "environment" {
      type    = string
      default = "production"
      }

      resource "aws_instance" "example" {
      ami           = "ami-0123456789abcdef0"
      instance_type = "t2.micro"

      count = var.environment == "production" ? 3 : 1

      tags = {
          Name = "example-instance-${count.index + 1}"
      }
      }
      ```

    So, if three instances are being created (`count.index` will be 0, 1, and 2):

    - `example-instance-1`
    - `example-instance-2`
    - `example-instance-3`

2.  **`if` and `else` Blocks:**

    - Use `if` and `else` for more complex conditions.
    - Example:

      ```hcl
      variable "is_production" {
      type    = bool
      default = true
      }

      resource "aws_instance" "example" {
      ami           = "ami-0123456789abcdef0"
      instance_type = "t2.micro"

      count = var.is_production ? 3 : 1
      }
      ```

## Loops and Iterations:

1.  **`count` for Resource Iteration:**

    - Use `count` to iterate over resources based on a condition.
    - Example:

      ```hcl
      variable "instance_count" {
      type    = number
      default = 3
      }

      resource "aws_instance" "example" {
      ami           = "ami-0123456789abcdef0"
      instance_type = "t2.micro"

      count = var.instance_count
      }
      ```

    - The `count` attribute is set to the value of `var.instance_count`,
    - means it will create **three** instances, as in `instance_count` variable.

2.  **`for` Expression:**

    - Use `for` expressions for iterating over lists or maps.
    - Example:

      ```hcl
      variable "colors" {
      type    = list(string)
      default = ["red", "green", "blue"]
      }

      locals {
      uppercase_colors = [for color in var.colors : upper(color)]
      }
      ```

    - The result is a new list named `uppercase_colors` containing the uppercase versions of the colors in the original list.

### Best Practices for Effective Control Flow:

1.  **Keep it Simple:**

    - Use straightforward conditional logic for readability.
    - Complex conditions can be challenging to understand.

2.  **Use Consistent Formatting:**

    - Maintain a consistent style for control flow statements.
    - This enhances readability and makes your configuration more maintainable.

3.  **Separate Logic into Modules:**

    - When control flow becomes complex, consider modularizing your code.
    - Modules encapsulate logic and improve organization.

4.  **Comments for Clarity:**

    - Add comments to explain complex conditions or loop logic.
    - This helps collaborators understand the intention behind the code.
