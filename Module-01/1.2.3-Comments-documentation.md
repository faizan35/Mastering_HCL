# Comments and documentation

### Comments in HCL:

Comments are used to add explanatory notes within your configuration. There are two types of comments in HCL:

1.  **Single-line Comments:**

    - Prefix a line with `#` to create a single-line comment.
    - Example:

    ```hcl
    # This is a single-line comment
    variable "region" {
    type    = string
    default = "us-east-1"
    }
    ```

1.  **Multi-line Comments:**

    - Enclose multiple lines with `/*` and `*/` to create a block comment.
    - Example:

    ```hcl
    /*
    This is a multi-line comment.
    It provides additional information about the configuration.
    */
    variable "region" {
    type    = string
    default = "us-east-1"
    }
    ```

### Documentation in HCL:

Documentation is typically used to provide information about the purpose and usage of various elements in your configuration. While HCL itself doesn't have a specific syntax for documentation, you can use comments effectively for this purpose.

Here's an example of how you might document a variable:

```hcl
# variable "region" represents the AWS region for resource deployment.
# It is a string type variable with a default value of "us-east-1".
variable "region" {
  type    = string
  default = "us-east-1"
}
```

In this example:

- The single-line comments provide brief descriptions of the variable, including its purpose, data type, and default value.
- The comments act as documentation, helping users understand the role of the variable and how to use it.

When writing documentation in comments:

- **Be Clear and Concise:** Write comments that are easy to understand.
- **Update Regularly:** Keep comments up-to-date as the configuration evolves.
- **Use Consistent Formatting:** Follow a consistent style for comments to enhance readability.
