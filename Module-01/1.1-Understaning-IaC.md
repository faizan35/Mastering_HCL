# 1.1: Understanding Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

#### 1.1.1 Definition and Benefits of IaC

**Definition of IaC:** Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is a practice that involves managing and provisioning computing infrastructure through machine-readable script files, rather than through physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools.

**Benefits of IaC:**

- **Consistency:** Ensures consistency in infrastructure deployments across environments.
- **Version Control:** Infrastructure configurations can be versioned and tracked.
- **Automation:** Reduces manual intervention, automating provisioning and management tasks.
- **Scalability:** Easily scale infrastructure up or down based on demand.
- **Collaboration:** Facilitates collaboration among development, operations, and other teams.

#### 1.1.2 Role of HCL in IaC Workflows

**HCL in IaC:** HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL) is a language specifically designed for defining configurations in HashiCorp tools like Terraform, Packer, and Consul. It serves as the bridge between human-readable configuration files and the automation of infrastructure provisioning.

**Key Aspects:**

- **Declarative Syntax:** HCL allows you to declare the desired state of your infrastructure without specifying the step-by-step procedures to achieve it.
- **Ease of Use:** HCL is designed to be human-readable and writable, making it accessible to both developers and operators.
- **Interpolation:** HCL supports variable interpolation, allowing dynamic values to be inserted into configurations.

#### 1.1.3 Overview of HashiCorp Tools using HCL

**Common HashiCorp Tools:**

1.  **Terraform:** Used for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure efficiently.
2.  **Packer:** Creates identical machine images for multiple platforms from a single source configuration.
3.  **Consul:** Provides a foundation for service discovery and runtime configuration.

**HCL in Terraform:**

- In Terraform, HCL is used to define infrastructure resources, their configurations, and dependencies.

**Example Terraform HCL:**

```hcl
# Example Terraform HCL for an AWS instance
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-west-2"
}

resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
}
```

### Exercise:

1.  **Install Terraform:**

    - Follow the installation guide for Terraform: Terraform Installation Guide

2.  **Create a Simple Terraform Configuration:**

    - Write a basic Terraform configuration using HCL.
    - Use the configuration to create an AWS EC2 instance.

3.  **Run Terraform Commands:**

    - Initialize the Terraform configuration with `terraform init`.
    - Preview the changes with `terraform plan`.
    - Apply the changes with `terraform apply`.

4.  **Explore Terraform State:**

    - Understand the Terraform state and how it tracks the current state of your infrastructure.
