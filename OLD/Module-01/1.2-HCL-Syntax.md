# 1.2: HCL Syntax Fundamentals

#### 1.3.1 Blocks, Types, and Parameters

**Understanding HCL Structure:**

- HCL configurations are organized into blocks.
- Each block has a type and a set of parameters.

**Example HCL Block:**

```hcl
# Block Type: provider
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-west-2"
}
```

- In this example, `provider` is the block type, and `aws` is the provider name.
- The block contains a parameter `region` with the value `"us-west-2"`.

#### 1.3.2 Variables and Data Types

**Defining Variables:**

- Variables in HCL are declared using the `variable` keyword.

**Example HCL Variable:**

```hcl
# Variable Definition
variable "region" {
  type    = string
  default = "us-west-2"
}

# Using the Variable
provider "aws" {
  region = var.region
}
```

- In this example, we define a variable named `region` of type `string` with a default value of `"us-west-2"`.
- The `var.region` syntax is used to reference the value of the variable.

#### 1.3.3 Comments and Documentation

**Adding Comments:**

- Comments in HCL are preceded by the `#` symbol.

**Example HCL Comments:**

```hcl
# This is a single-line comment

/*
  This is a
  multi-line comment
*/
```

**Documentation Strings:**

- You can document your configurations using documentation strings.

**Example HCL Documentation String:**

```hcl
"""
This is a documentation string.
It provides information about the purpose of the block or configuration.
"""
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-west-2"
}
```

### Exercise:

1.  **Create Variable Configurations:**

    - Define a few variables for your Terraform configuration (e.g., `instance_type`, `subnet_id`).
    - Use these variables in your resource configurations.

2.  **Experiment with Blocks and Types:**

    - Explore different block types and parameters in the Terraform documentation.
    - Create a simple configuration using a new block type.

3.  **Add Comments and Documentation:**

    - Add comments to your existing Terraform configuration to explain the purpose of each block.
    - Experiment with documentation strings.

4.  **Apply and Verify Changes:**

    - Apply the changes to your Terraform configuration and verify that the infrastructure is created as expected.
